- This Code of Merit should not be needed in the first place: its necessity reveals the flaws of the current solutions being used in the software industry. Recognize that fact, and the existence of other viable solutions.
- Software is like nature, it is evolutive, the best implementation must prevail.
- You will contribute, you will learn, and you will make mistakes. Mistakes not only are allowed, but foster this learning.
- We are imperfect creatures by nature. Recognize your imperfections and those of others, that mistakes are not final, and that everybody has a second chance.
- Conversely, recognize that others will not do or help with your work forever. Learning and improving is not optional for success.
- Harassment as defined by law will not be allowed. Questioning is not harassment. Repeated questioning after an individual has stated their desire for disengagement is harassment. The difference is clear.
- Censorship will not be permitted. Seeking to silence an individual voicing constructive opinions will not be allowed. Silencing vitriol is not censorship. The difference is clear.
- This is a space for technical prowess, world politics have no place here.
- Everything that makes a person an individual, including but not limited to body, sex, sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality, or political preferences, is irrelevant in the scope of a technical project.
- Everybody is and will continue to be different. Differences are not a weapon to be used against others for suffering or enjoyment. We are all individuals seeking the common goal of improving ourselves and improving our collective project. The only differences that matter are in technical prowess and opinion.
- Regardless of differences, everybody has the same rights and the same opportunities to strive to meet any challenge they choose. The chance to make mistakes (see above) will not be denied to anybody.
- There is no room for ambiguity: if an individual is ambiguous regarding a statement it is up to the individual to provide more context. Ambiguity will be met with questioning, further ambiguity will be met with silence.
- If a discussion arises that cannot be solved in the space of the project, it will be ventilated/discussed in a separate space. Disruption of the project will not be allowed.
- This Code of Merit does not take precedence over governing law.
